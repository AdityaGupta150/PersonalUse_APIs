*API endpoints accept arguments either as url-encoded values for non-POST requests or as json-encoded objects encoded in POST request body with Content-Type: application/json header.
Each modification request may provide additional X-Request-Id HTTP header that could be used as an unique string to ensure modifications are applied only once â€” request having the same id as previously seen would be discarded.

*Labels won't make much difference, but they will be stored internally, so that...
	For eg. I have a project in the 'Github', and the 'General' collections... i can have the label #ludo in both... so it may be a way of cross collection link (just a fancy nothing special... just saying that inside a collection... labels can make the `purpose` clear, eg. about #ludo, or about #apis, #learnt)

*Try to have a different section of LEARNT... they wont have a due date, but labels will make it clear what is it about... and by default when i search #cpp, todos from 'learnt' collections shouldn't show up

*ignoring /sections routes... i am using collections... but the project_id is more relevant, due to the way my previous todos are
*ignoring /comments routes, FOR NOW... try to implement it later (attachments will be written into comments)

*when a recurring task is closed, what actually happens is that its due date is updated
*non-completed recurring tasks aren't reopened, any such request to be ignored
