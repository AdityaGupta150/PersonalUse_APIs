Short for `UseFul APIs`, (currently primarily specific to my use cases though :D)

![Deploy Check](https://github.com/AdityaGupta150/Useful_APIs/workflows/Deploy%20Check/badge.svg)

A collection of 'probably' all APIs i will be using for my webApps, or for utilising REST requests

## Deployment

You can try the deployment available at `adig15.herokuapp.com`, but that is severely limited, in number of calls allowed, but enough to try

Or deploy your own version ->

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/AdityaGupta150/Useful_APIs)

## Documentation

The documentation of the API are in 2 forms ->

* Inside code -> There are comments that explain what a route does, including the request object body, query, params that are accepted/expected, with status codes it responds with
* Postman Documentation -> The documentation is also available at the below link, where you can read the purpose in brief, as well as request code aside it.

> Note - The explanations/briefs given in code and at postman are almost same, only difference being that the online postman doc has the request urls aside them too

Currently the documentation is also available at ->
